I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Yale University. 

My research interests center on the effects of large-scale regulatory policy. I am particularly interested in using methods from empirical industrial organization to estimate the equilibrium impacts of such policies and evaluate the likely impacts of counterfactual policies. In my job market paper, I study how a rural branch expansion policy in India reshaped the bank branch network as a whole. In another project, I explore the role of technology and capital adjustment frictions in U.S. manufacturing plants' reponses to climate policy.
